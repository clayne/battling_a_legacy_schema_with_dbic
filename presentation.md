## Why DBIx::Class?

For any non-trivial application you're going to write a model anyway.

Most trivial applications turn into non-trivial applications.

So "don't leak the abstraction"

DBIx::Class offers many useful features, as we shall see.

Note:
- quote from Ovid
- no writing same SQL over and over
- concentrate on the business logic
- objects
