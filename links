### High Level View:

11:31 <@ribasushi> if you have an existing gnarly database you want to wrap your head
                   around, vanstyn_'s rdbic is a superb tool building on top of the ecosystem:

### Feedback from riba

10:48 <ribasushi> I really wouldn't show the
                  m2m in "polymorphic rels"
10:48 <ribasushi> write it out longhand via
                  search_related
10:48 <ribasushi> gives them instant visual
                  "Oh! I can walk anywhere"
10:49 <ribasushi> and reinforces the point
                  of where the query happens
                  (nowhere during search_*)

10:51 <ribasushi> don't forget to stress
                  that this is a toolkit
                  rather than (more
                  traditional ORM-like)
                  framework

10:52 <ribasushi> i.e. "If an existing
                  gnarly query looks like it
                  will be hard to map to
                  DBIC - *IT PROBABLY IS*,
                  and you should
                  $schema->storage->dbh_do()
                  and be in your way"
10:52 <ribasushi> ^^ this is arguably the #1
                  problem with newcomers to
                  DBIC, they see it as "all
                  or nothing"
